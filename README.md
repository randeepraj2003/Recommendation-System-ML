# Recommendation-System-ML

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **machine learning–based Recommendation System** that suggests relevant products to users based on their preferences and past interactions. The goal is to improve **personalization, user engagement, and decision-making** on digital platforms such as e-commerce websites.

---

##  Objectives

* Understand user behavior through data analysis
* Build a recommendation engine for personalized suggestions
* Apply machine learning techniques to real-world data
* Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics

---

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to users, products, and their interactions. It includes features such as user identifiers, item identifiers, and interaction details used to generate recommendations.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Techniques:** EDA, Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning

---

##  Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values and duplicates
* Transformed and encoded data for modeling
* Prepared user–item interaction data

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed user activity and item popularity
* Identified patterns, trends, and sparsity in data
* Visualized key insights for better understanding

### 3. Model Building

* Implemented a recommendation approach using machine learning
* Generated personalized product recommendations

### 4. Model Evaluation

* Evaluated recommendation quality using relevant metrics
* Ensured recommendations were accurate and meaningful

---

##  Key Results

* Successfully generated personalized recommendations
* Improved understanding of user preferences
* Demonstrated end-to-end machine learning workflow

---

##  Business Impact

* Enhances user experience through personalization
* Increases user engagement and retention
* Supports data-driven decision-making

---

##  Challenges Faced

* Data sparsity in user–item interactions
* Cold-start problem for new users/items
* Selecting appropriate evaluation metrics

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Implement hybrid recommendation systems
* Use deep learning–based recommenders
* Add real-time recommendation capability
* Perform A/B testing for online evaluation

---

##  Learnings

* Built an end-to-end recommendation system
* Gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing and EDA
* Applied machine learning to solve personalization problems
